# Contributing

If you'd like to contribute to this project, please **make your PRs scoped**, even if this requires you to open several ones.
For example, if you fix a typo and enhance some code, propose these changes in two different PRs.

If you're fixing a bug, make sure to tag the corresponding issue in the title of your PR (look at the other closed PRs if you need to).
If no issue matches your PR, make sure to open one beforehand.
