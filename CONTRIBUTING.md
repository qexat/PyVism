# Contributing

Thank you for contributing! It's very appreciated. ‚ô•Ô∏è\
Please verify that you can check the following boxes.

## Before opening a PR

-   [ ] The PR has a defined scope, it changes one thing (and not any unrelated other)
-   [ ] If it is a bug fix, there is an opened issue<sup>1</sup>

<sup>1</sup> If no issue exists about the bug, don't hesitate to open one~

## Once the PR is opened

-   [ ] If it is a bug fix, you tagged the related issue in the PR title<sup>2</sup>
-   [ ] If needed, you wrote the reasons of your change(s) in the PR description

<sup>2</sup> The recommended formatting is: `GH-XXX: <title>` with `XXX` being the issue number.\

### Suggested, but not enforced:

-   [ ] The changes you made are in a separate branch (i.e. not your fork's `main`)
-   [ ] The pre-commit CI status passes

## Once the PR is merged

Thank you again~ Your contribution is very valuable.\
You can now delete your branch safely. üòÑ

## My PR got closed...

We cherish your willingness to participate to the project!
Perhaps your PR did not meet the requirements or another path was chosen.

Don't get discouraged! Your future PRs will be looked at in detail and one of them might get merged~

**Happy coding~**
